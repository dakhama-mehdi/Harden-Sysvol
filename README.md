## Description
*Hardensysvol* is a PowerShell module designed to enhance Active Directory (AD) security by analyzing and detecting threats within the Sysvol folder. It scans for sensitive keywords, identifies suspicious files, and generates a detailed HTML report for easier filtering. 

Hardensysvol can be used for AD audits or pentesting, complementing existing solutions such as PingCastle, PurpleKnight, and GPOZaurr.
